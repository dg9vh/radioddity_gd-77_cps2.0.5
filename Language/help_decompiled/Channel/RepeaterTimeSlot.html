<hr class = "HrColor" />
<p><font class="Descript">Utilizes digital Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology to divide a 12.5kHz channel into two alternating time slots, with each carrying an individual call when operating in Repeater mode. As a result, both the assigned frequency and the assigned time slot must be specified in order to completely describe a digital repeater channel. Radios or Groups that need to talk together must be assigned to the same frequency and time slot. This is a channel-wide feature.
</font></p>
<strong>Note</strong> 
<ul>
<li>This function is only available for relay mode and dual capacity direct mode.</li>
<li>The intercom configured for the relay station slot 1 or slot 2 operation always listens to a radio that is transmitted in a desirably mode, regardless of which slot is configured for listening in the repeater mode. The receiving intercom in the off-network mode will be able to listen to all outgoing calls and trunk calls on the configured repeater time slot.</li>
<li>For connecting supercapacitor channels, this function needs to be set to the same value as slot 1 channel ID.</li>
<li>Only digital mode supports this feature.</li>
